Little games I created as I was learning to code

Learned primarily through Automate the Boring Stuff and rmotr.com


Game of Doom: This is a text-based adventure game.
The player goes through a 'dungeon' and has to find a door to escape.
It's played by just running the code and inputting the commands.
